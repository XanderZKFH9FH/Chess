# Chess
This a console application to play local 2 player chess.
Basically you give in 2 coordinates and the piece moves from the first coordinate to the second, i used ai to clean up my code a bit.
Alter the code as you see fit, this is one of my first projects and is written in C#.
I am looking forward to when i can share more comprehensive and good projects.
